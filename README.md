# What is System Design ?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It is a high-level blueprint of how different parts of a system will work together to achieve a given goal. This discipline is commonly applied to software systems but can also encompass hardware or a combination of both.
