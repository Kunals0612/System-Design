# Data Consistency

**Data consistency** refers to the accuracy, correctness, and uniformity of data across a database or system. It ensures that the data reflects a single, coherent state throughout its lifecycle. In simple terms, data consistency guarantees that the data remains the same and accurate, no matter where or how it is accessed, updated, or stored.

## Key Aspects of Data Consistency
1. **Correctness**: The data values meet the predefined rules, constraints, and relationships.
2. **Uniformity**: No conflicting or duplicate data exists across the database.
3. **Synchronization**: Changes in one part of the system are correctly propagated to all related parts.

### Example:
- In a **banking system**, if you transfer $500 from Account A to Account B:
  - The amount deducted from Account A should match the amount added to Account B.
  - Both accounts should reflect the transaction simultaneously.
  - Any system query during or after the transaction should not show partial or conflicting data.

## Types of Consistency
1. **Strong Consistency**: Ensures that after an update, every read reflects the most recent write (e.g., relational databases with ACID properties).
2. **Eventual Consistency**: Guarantees that, over time, all replicas of data will converge to the same value (e.g., distributed systems like NoSQL databases).
3. **Consistency in Transactions (ACID)**:
   - **Atomicity**: Transactions are all-or-nothing.
   - **Consistency**: Transitions leave the database in a valid state.
   - **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere.
   - **Durability**: Changes persist after a transaction is committed.

## Challenges in Data Consistency
- **Distributed Systems**: Achieving consistency across geographically dispersed nodes can be challenging.
- **Concurrency**: Simultaneous transactions can cause conflicts if not managed properly.
- **Network Failures**: Can lead to delays or discrepancies in data synchronization.

Data consistency is crucial for reliable and trustworthy systems, ensuring the integrity of data even during operations like updates, deletions, or transactions.


## Data Consistency Levels

In distributed systems and databases, different levels of consistency are used to balance performance, availability, and reliability. Below are the commonly defined levels of data consistency:

### 1. **Strong Consistency**
- Ensures that after an update, all reads return the most recent write, no matter which node or replica is queried.
- Ideal for applications where accuracy and reliability are critical (e.g., banking systems, inventory management).
- **Trade-off**: Increased latency and reduced availability in distributed systems.

### 2. **Eventual Consistency**
- Guarantees that, over time, all replicas will converge to the same value, but there may be a delay.
- Suitable for systems requiring high availability and partition tolerance (e.g., NoSQL databases like Cassandra, DynamoDB).
- **Example**: Social media feeds where posts may appear at different times across devices.

### 3. **Causal Consistency**
- Ensures that operations that are causally related are seen in the correct order by all nodes.
- Operations with no causal relationship can be seen in any order.
- Useful for collaborative applications where the sequence of events matters.

### 4. **Read-Your-Writes Consistency**
- Guarantees that a user always reads the most recent value they wrote, even if replicas may not yet be consistent.
- Helps maintain user session consistency, such as in profile updates.

### 5. **Monotonic Read Consistency**
- Ensures that once a user reads a value, they will never see an older value, even if switching between replicas.
- Ideal for applications requiring sequential consistency for a single user's operations.

### 6. **Consistency in CAP Theorem**
- The **CAP theorem** states that a distributed system can guarantee at most two out of three properties:
  1. **Consistency (C)**: Every read receives the most recent write.
  2. **Availability (A)**: Every request receives a response, even if some nodes are down.
  3. **Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system continues to function despite network partitions.
- Systems often compromise on consistency for availability and partition tolerance.

Understanding data consistency levels helps design systems that meet specific application requirements for performance, reliability, and scalability.

## Transaction Isolation Levels

Transaction isolation levels define the degree to which transactions are isolated from each other in a database. They determine how changes made in one transaction are visible to other transactions, helping balance performance and consistency.

### Types of Isolation Levels (Defined by SQL Standard)

### 1. **Read Uncommitted**
- **Description**: Transactions can read data that has been modified but not yet committed by other transactions.
- **Advantages**: Fastest isolation level; no locking overhead.
- **Disadvantages**: Allows **dirty reads** (reading uncommitted changes), leading to potential inconsistencies.
- **Use Case**: Scenarios where accuracy is less critical than performance.

### 2. **Read Committed**
- **Description**: Transactions can only read data that has been committed by other transactions.
- **Advantages**: Prevents dirty reads; ensures a higher level of consistency compared to `Read Uncommitted`.
- **Disadvantages**: Allows **non-repeatable reads** (data might change if read again within the same transaction).
- **Use Case**: Most common isolation level, providing a balance between consistency and performance.

### 3. **Repeatable Read**
- **Description**: Ensures that if a transaction reads the same data twice, it will see the same value, even if other transactions are updating the data.
- **Advantages**: Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads.
- **Disadvantages**: Allows **phantom reads** (new rows can appear in subsequent reads due to inserts by other transactions).
- **Use Case**: Scenarios requiring consistent reads but not complete isolation.

### 4. **Serializable**
- **Description**: Ensures complete isolation of transactions by serializing them (executing sequentially).
- **Advantages**: Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads; provides the highest level of consistency.
- **Disadvantages**: Slowest isolation level; high locking overhead and reduced concurrency.
- **Use Case**: Applications requiring absolute accuracy, such as financial systems.

### Phenomena Addressed by Isolation Levels

| Isolation Level      | Dirty Reads | Non-Repeatable Reads | Phantom Reads |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| **Read Uncommitted** | Possible    | Possible             | Possible      |
| **Read Committed**   | Prevented   | Possible             | Possible      |
| **Repeatable Read**  | Prevented   | Prevented            | Possible      |
| **Serializable**     | Prevented   | Prevented            | Prevented     |

---

### Choosing the Right Isolation Level
- **Low Concurrency Needs**: Use `Serializable` for maximum consistency.
- **Moderate Concurrency Needs**: Use `Repeatable Read` or `Read Committed` for a balance of consistency and performance.
- **High Concurrency Needs**: Use `Read Uncommitted` for minimal locking but with consistency trade-offs.

Transaction isolation levels are crucial for managing concurrency and ensuring data integrity in multi-user database systems. Choose the level that best aligns with your application's requirements for consistency, concurrency, and performance.
