# Data Consistency

**Data consistency** refers to the accuracy, correctness, and uniformity of data across a database or system. It ensures that the data reflects a single, coherent state throughout its lifecycle. In simple terms, data consistency guarantees that the data remains the same and accurate, no matter where or how it is accessed, updated, or stored.

## Key Aspects of Data Consistency
1. **Correctness**: The data values meet the predefined rules, constraints, and relationships.
2. **Uniformity**: No conflicting or duplicate data exists across the database.
3. **Synchronization**: Changes in one part of the system are correctly propagated to all related parts.

### Example:
- In a **banking system**, if you transfer $500 from Account A to Account B:
  - The amount deducted from Account A should match the amount added to Account B.
  - Both accounts should reflect the transaction simultaneously.
  - Any system query during or after the transaction should not show partial or conflicting data.

## Types of Consistency
1. **Strong Consistency**: Ensures that after an update, every read reflects the most recent write (e.g., relational databases with ACID properties).
2. **Eventual Consistency**: Guarantees that, over time, all replicas of data will converge to the same value (e.g., distributed systems like NoSQL databases).
3. **Consistency in Transactions (ACID)**:
   - **Atomicity**: Transactions are all-or-nothing.
   - **Consistency**: Transitions leave the database in a valid state.
   - **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere.
   - **Durability**: Changes persist after a transaction is committed.

## Challenges in Data Consistency
- **Distributed Systems**: Achieving consistency across geographically dispersed nodes can be challenging.
- **Concurrency**: Simultaneous transactions can cause conflicts if not managed properly.
- **Network Failures**: Can lead to delays or discrepancies in data synchronization.

Data consistency is crucial for reliable and trustworthy systems, ensuring the integrity of data even during operations like updates, deletions, or transactions.
