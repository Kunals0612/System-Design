# What is System Design ?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It is a high-level blueprint of how different parts of a system will work together to achieve a given goal. This discipline is commonly applied to software systems but can also encompass hardware or a combination of both.

**Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more machines or servers to a system to distribute the load and increase capacity (e.g., adding more servers to a cluster). It improves scalability by working across multiple nodes.
**Vertical Scaling**: : Upgrading the resources (CPU, RAM, storage) of a single machine or server to handle increased demand. It enhances performance but is limited by hardware capacity.

E.g. Buy Bigger Machine: Vertical Scaling.
     Buy More Machine: Horizontal Scaling.
