# Message Queue

## What is a Message Queue?
A **message queue** is a communication system used to facilitate asynchronous message passing between different components of a system. It enables the exchange of information (messages) between producers (senders) and consumers (receivers) without requiring them to interact directly or simultaneously.

### Key Concepts
1. **Producer**: The component that sends messages to the queue.
2. **Consumer**: The component that retrieves messages from the queue.
3. **Queue**: A data structure where messages are stored temporarily until consumed.
4. **Broker**: A service that manages the queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, AWS SQS).

### Benefits of Message Queues
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Producers and consumers work independently.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes workloads among consumers.
- **Resiliency**: Messages are stored until processed, ensuring no data loss.
- **Scalability**: Producers and consumers can scale independently.
- **Decoupling**: Components don’t need to know about each other’s existence.

## How Message Queues Work
1. A producer sends a message to the queue.
2. The message is stored in the queue until a consumer is ready to process it.
3. A consumer retrieves the message from the queue and processes it.

## Example Scenario: Online Food Ordering System
### Problem
- A restaurant’s system receives food orders from multiple customers.
- The kitchen staff processes these orders sequentially.
- The ordering system and kitchen operate independently.

### Solution with a Message Queue
1. **Producer**: The ordering system sends order details as a message to the queue.
2. **Message Queue**: Stores the order details temporarily.
3. **Consumer**: The kitchen retrieves orders from the queue one by one and prepares the food.

## Code Example: Message Queue Using RabbitMQ in Python

### Producer (Sender)
```python
import pika

# Establish a connection to RabbitMQ
connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
channel = connection.channel()

# Declare a queue
channel.queue_declare(queue='order_queue')

# Send a message
channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='order_queue', body='Order #1: Pizza')
print("Order sent to queue!")

# Close connection
connection.close()

```java
system.out.println("Hello");
